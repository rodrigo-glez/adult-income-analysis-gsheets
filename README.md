# Adult Income Analysis Practice

This project explores a sample of U.S. Census data to uncover patterns and relationships related to adult income. The dataset includes demographic and employment-related variables, allowing for both descriptive and inferential analysis.

The goal of this analysis is twofold:

- Practice fundamental data analytics techniques including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization â€” all performed in Google Sheets.

- Apply inferential statistics to draw conclusions about the broader U.S. working adult population, using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

This project is part of my learning journey through the [DeepLearning.AI Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/data-analytics/), and serves as an independent initiative to consolidate my knowladge.
